# Let's get that bread

Many folks start podcasting out of passion, but realize that the expenses involved can add up quickly. Pinecast makes it easy to start making money with our Tip Jar.

The tip jar lets your listeners create recurring or one-month subscriptions to your podcast. Paid subscribers can hear episodes that you mark as private (or "premium") and [send messages](/features/feedback) directly to your feedback inbox.

# We handle it all

## For all listeners

Pinecast's tip jar works for all listeners, regardless of which app they use. We provide a unique, private RSS feed to each subscribers [that works in any podcast app](https://help.pinecast.com/article/61-subscribing-to-a-private-rss-feed) that can subscribe via RSS.

We also have a web dashboard for listeners that prefer to use their browser. They'll find that it keeps track of episodes they've listened to, just like if they used an app on their phone.

## No convenience fees

Many platforms, like the Apple Podcasters Program, take a cut of each payment. These fees can be 30% or more. Pinecast doesn't take a cut of your earnings: you only pay a 2.9% + $0.30 fee (or equivalent) per payment.
