# The data you need

We provide a wide array of views for your analytics data. You can choose time ranges for most views. For time series data, you can choose the granularity to view the results by (day, week, month). Most views are timezone-adjusted to your computer's clock.

Every analytics view includes an explanation of what you're looking at and how to interpret the data, so you're never without context. We'll even annotate your charts to show when episodes were published. And of course, you can download any view as a CSV.

## Unique views

See when your listeners download episodes, the relative rate of growth of episodes, the locations of listeners, and more. We're confident that we have one of the largest selections—if not the largest selection—of analytics views of any podcast host. Moreover, the charts we provide are thoughtfully designed to answer real questions about your podcast; they're not just nice to look at.

With all of this detail comes some complexity, but don't worry: below each chart is an explanation of the data, including specifics about what's included and what's not, and whether the data is timezone-adjusted.

Pinecast offers 19 analytics views for podcasts, 13 views for episodes, and 16 views for podcast networks (available with our Crew add-on). You'll be hard-pressed to find another host that provides as much data with the same quality as Pinecast.

You can see all of the details for all of our analytics views [on our support site](https://pinecast.support/en/articles/935524-analytics).
