  Nobody likes sharing passwords. Pinecast makes it easy to work on your podcast with friends, coworkers, or whoever you produce with.

# Podcast with friends

Going it alone can be hard! With our Crew add-on ($10/mo or $110/year), adding collaborators to your podcast is as simple as entering the email address of their Pinecast account.

Your collaborators don't need a paid subscription to Pinecast to work on your show as a collaborator. As soon as they're added, they'll be able to see information like [analytics](/features/analytics), create and edit episodes, and edit some configuration.

## Security

Rest assured that your show is safe. Collaborators don't have [tip jar](/features/monetization) access, the ability to delete or redirect your podcast, or perform other administrative functions.
