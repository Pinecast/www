# Embed your podcast

Whether you're trying to share a single episode or all of them, we've got you covered. All of our players have customization options and have baked-in accessibility features.

## Podcast player

If you want to share all of your episodes, the Player tab on your podcast dashboard lets you choose colors for a full podcast player.

Episodes are played sequentially, with speed and volume controls. Hovering the cover art shows a button to let your listeners subscribe to your show.

## Episode player

If you'd like to share a single episode, visit the episode's dashboard and choose the Player tab. Episode players have theme options available for a variety of use cases. Some themes will show subtitles for episodes that have been transcribed.

Unlike plain HTML embeds, these players meet IAB guidelines to keep analytics accurate. The code and infrastructure are optimized for performance by minimizing the number of files that need to be loaded.
